      // Variable Declaration:
      // Declare a variable named city but do not assign any value to it.

      let city;

      // Assigning a Value:
      // Assign the value "Los Angeles" to the previously declared variable city.
      city = "Los Angeles";
      // Reassignment:
      // Declare a variable age and assign it a value. Later, reassign it to a different value.
      let age = 14;
      age = 20;
      console.log(age); //20
      // Basic Arithmetic:
      // Declare two variables, x and y, with any two numbers. Declare a third variable z that should store the result of adding x and y.
      const x = 2;
      const y = 4;
      const z = x + y;
      console.log(z); //6

      // String Concatenation:
      // Declare a variable intro and assign it the value "Hi, my name is". Declare another variable myName and assign it any name. Now, concatenate intro and myName to form a full introduction.
      let intro = "Hi, my name is ";

      let myName = "Paul";
      console.log(intro + myName); //Hi, my name is Paul
